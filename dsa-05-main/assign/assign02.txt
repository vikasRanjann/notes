2. Implement Fibonacci search. Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fibonacci-search/
3. Write a function to return number of comparisons for a bubble sort. Write another function to return number of swapping for bubble sort. Compare result for the same input array.
4. Do paperwork and calculate time complexity of insertion sort if array is already sorted.
5. Modify the insertion sort algorithm to sort the array in descending order.
