1. Implement Prim's MST for Adjacency List implementation.
2. You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
Return the minimum cost to make all points connected.
	Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
	Output: 20
